## Why R ?

### Community

* SatRDay, R user groups, meet-up, conference
* CRAN community [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)
* Rstudio community [https://community.rstudio.com/](https://community.rstudio.com/)
* R dev/package well integrated on [github](http://github.com)

### Packages manager

* more than 13,000 community-based libraries
* cutting-edges statistical methods
* easy to learn even for non-statistician/data scientist

### Reproducibility

* Rmarkdown is not just notebook
* Great for interfacing, plotting, scientific reports

## Why not R?

- Easy to make dirty code (less and less true)

- Not typed language, not compilation by default: may be slow

- Many ways to do the same things

- Less well interfaced to ML/Deep-learning library than Python


## Why R again?

### The Rstudio group

Even if it is a company...

\&nbsp; 

- Rstudio API is a great all-in-one tool for data analysis and development

- Cleaner implementation (tidyverse and co)

- New functionalities (unitary test, github integration)  

- Interface to deep learning tools (Tensor Flow, Keras, Torch, etc.)  

- Interface with Python (reticulate)

- Nice surrogate Oriented-Object programming with R6 

\&nbsp; 

\rsa Rstudio basically saved \C{R} from \C{Python}
