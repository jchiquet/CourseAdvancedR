## The R console

- \C{help(str), ?str}: launch dedicated help for command \C{str},
- \C{help.search("factorial"), ??factorial}:  look for command with key word \C{factorial},
- \C{help.start(), ???}: launch the HTML help pages in a browser 

## The Rstudio IDE

- A full IDE with code, interpreter, workspace and plots

- Package development and external code integration are easier

- Notebooks integration with Rmarkdown

- Interface with github

\rsa Rstudio is a state-of-the-art tool for efficient development in `R`
