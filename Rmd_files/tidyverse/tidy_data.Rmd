## Tidy data: motivation

Collected data are (never) under a proper canonical format

## Tidy data: what?

### First, a subjective question
What is the _observation/statistical unit_ in your data?

### Definition
_Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. A dataset is messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables are matched up with observations, variables and types._\


\pause

In tidy data,

1. each variable forms a column,
2. each observation forms a row,
3. each observational unit have its own cell

## Tidy data: why? 

![Tidy data](../Rmd_files/tidyverse/figs/tidy_data.png)

 - make manipulation, visualization and modelling easier
 - a common structure for all packages
 - a philosophy for data representation (beyond the `R` framework) 

## Tidy or not ?
 
```{r show_non_tidy1}
tidyr::table3
```

## Tidy or not ?
 
```{r show_non_tidy2}
tidyr::table2
```

## Tidy or not ?
 
```{r show_tidy}
tidyr::table1
```
