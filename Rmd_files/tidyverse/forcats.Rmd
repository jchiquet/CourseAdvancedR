## {forcats}

![a suite of useful tools that solve common problems with factor](../Rmd_files/tidyverse/figs/hex-forcats.png){width="100px"}

### `forcats` versus `base` factors

- easy use in conjuction with other tidyverse packages
- correct inconsistent behaviours of `R` base factors facilities

## Convert to factor

```{r asfactor}
fruits <- c("banana", "apple", "mango", "apple", "pear", "apple", 
            "banana", "pitaya", "mango", "mango", "apple")
as.factor(fruits) # Use alphabetical order
```

\pause

```{r asfactor2}
forcats::as_factor(fruits) # Use appearance order 
## equivalent to factor(countries, levels = unique(countries))
```

Using appearance order increased reproducibility because it's independent from `locale()`.

## Change level names

```{r fct_recode}
fct_recode(fruits, dragonfruit = "pitaya")
```

\pause

```{r fct_relabel}
fct_relabel(fruits, str_to_title)
```

Note that when converting from strings to factors, `fct_recode()` and `fct_relabel()` use alphabetical order.

## Reorder levels

You can reorder levels:

* manually with `fct_relevel()`,

* by appearance with `fct_inorder()`,

* by frequency with `fct_infreq()`,

* according to another variable with `fct_reorder()`,

* according to the last value of another variable with `fct_reorder2()`,

* randomly with `fct_shuffle()`,

* by reversing order with `fct_rev()`...

## Reorder by frequency 

```{r fct_infreq}
fct_count(fruits, sort = TRUE)
fct_infreq(fruits)
```

## According to another variable 

```{r levelsiris}
levels(iris$Species)
``` 

```{r irisreorder}
iris$Species <- fct_reorder(iris$Species, iris$Sepal.Width)
ggplot(iris) + aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Width, fill = Species) + geom_boxplot()  
``` 

## Handling many modalities

A data set about nuclear testings and explosion around the world:
```{r}
library(tidytuesdayR)
nuclear <- tt_load("2019-08-20")$nuclear_explosion
```

```{r}
nuclear$type <- stringr::str_to_title(nuclear$type)
fct_count(nuclear$type, sort = TRUE)
```

## Lump least common factors


```{r lump-n}
table(fct_lump(nuclear$type, n = 5))
```

\pause

```{r lump-min}
table(fct_lump_min(nuclear$type, min = 20))
```

## Manually collapse levels

```{r}
nuclear_collapsed <- fct_collapse(nuclear$type, 
    Air = c("Atmosph", "Airdrop", "Balloon", "Rocket"),
    Underground = c("Shaft", "Tunnel", "Shaft/Gr", "Shaft/Lg", "Ug", "Gallery"),
    Water = c("Barge", "Uw", "Ship", "Water Su", "Watersur"), 
    other_level = "Other")
fct_count(nuclear_collapsed, sort = TRUE)
```
